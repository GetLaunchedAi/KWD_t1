    <p class="cs-text">
      We take pride in delivering top-quality lakeshore and landscape solutions—and our customers agree. From shoreline
      stabilization to custom patios and seawalls, we’ve helped Michigan homeowners transform their outdoor spaces with
      durable, beautiful results. Here’s what they have to say about working with New Leaf Landscapes & Lakeshores.

        <p class="cs-item-p">
          Newleaf Landscapes did some volunteer work for my disabled parents. What a professional job and what a
          blessing. They saw a need while working on one if their clients and when they completed that job they stepped
          up to help out a neighbor. They are a great company for our community.

          Very pleased with the work Bill and his crew did with our seawall. Like many we had lost yard due to rising
          lake levels, they came up with a great plan to work with our existing seawall. Hope this will keep us high and
          dry for years to come!
